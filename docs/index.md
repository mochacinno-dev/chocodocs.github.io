# Welcome to Choco
Choco is a high-level programming language, primarily intended for general use. It is designed to be a simple and convenient programming language for developers, borrowing syntax elements from Ruby, Go, and Rust!

```rust
fn greet(name) {
    return "Hello, #{name}!";
}

let greeting = greet("World");
puts greeting;
```

## Why Choose Choco?
- **Easy to use**: Simple, beautiful syntax that doesn't sacrifice readability or functionality
